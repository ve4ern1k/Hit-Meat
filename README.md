# Hit-Meat
Restaurant info site

It's a site for Novosibirsk restaurant Hit&Meat. Site was created with using HTML5 and CSS3.
There is a traditional page application with some web-pages and without back-end part.
There is one of my first projects. Now it's some cringe even for me.

Functional of this site is primitive, cause it's business card website, but there are some interesting features inside:
interconnected radiobuttons, adaptive background and beginning of my study of display-property in css.
